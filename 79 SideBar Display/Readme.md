## Overview

Using a LILYGO T-Display S3 Long, we make compact side display that snaps onto your keyboard.
It shows live YouTube stats, weather updates, a timer, and other mini-apps — all in one clean interface.

In this video I’ll walk you through the build, designing the UI using EEZ studio and LVGL, and how it all fits together.
Perfect for makers who want a simple, glanceable screen for their desk.
